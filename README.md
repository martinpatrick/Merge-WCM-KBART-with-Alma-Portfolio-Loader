# Merge WCM KBART with Alma Portfolio Loader
 A notebook to merge coverage data from WCM KBART files with data exported from the Alma Portfolio Loader

This script was developed in order to merge coverage dates data for WCM loaded collections in Alma. Because WCM does not currently deliver this data when using Deliver MARC Records it's necessary to add coverage date information at a later date. 

This is very much still a work in progress. If you feel comfortable with python and notebooks you should be able to use this!

To do:
* Make more user friendly
* Add more logic and helpful tools
* Use Alma APIs to fetch and then load the data
